## Discussion Questions

1. How do the authors define "structured reflection" and how does it differ from unstructured debugging?

2. What evidence do they present for the effectiveness of their approach?

3. How might these techniques be integrated into existing VT courses?

4. What are the potential barriers to adoption?

## Paper Summary

This paper investigates how explicit instruction in metacognitive strategies can help novice programmers develop better debugging and self-regulation skills. The authors conducted a controlled study with 150 CS1 students...
