## Discussion Questions

1. What unique challenges do rural schools face in offering technology education?

2. How do the findings compare to urban/suburban contexts?

3. What role can universities like VT play in supporting K-12 technology education?

4. How might VT's outreach programs be informed by this research?

## Paper Summary

This longitudinal study tracked CS course offerings and enrollment across 50 rural school districts over five years. The authors identify key barriers including teacher preparation, infrastructure, and community perceptions of computing careers.
